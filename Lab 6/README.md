## Overview

Build interactive systems where **multiple devices communicate over a network** using MQTT messaging. Work in teams of 3+ with Raspberry Pis.

**Parts:**
- A: Learn MQTT messaging
- B: Try collaborative pixel grid demo  
- C: Build your own distributed system

---

## Part A: MQTT Messaging

MQTT = lightweight messaging for IoT. Publish/subscribe model with central broker.

**Concepts:**
- **Broker**: `farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883`
- **Topic**: Like `IDD/bedroom/temperature` (use `#` wildcard)
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Send and receive messages

**Install MQTT tools on your Pi:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mosquitto-clients
```

**Test it:**

**Subscribe to messages (listener):**
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/#' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

**Publish a message (sender):**
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/test/yourname' -m 'Hello!' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

> **💡 Tips:**
> - Replace `yourname` with your actual name in the topic
> - Use single quotes around the password: `'device@theFarm'`

**🔧 Debug Tool:** View all MQTT messages in real-time at `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5001`

## Part B: Collaborative Pixel Grid

Each Pi = one pixel, controlled by RGB sensor, displayed in real-time grid.

**Architecture:** `Pi (sensor) → MQTT → Server → Web Browser`

**Setup:**

1. **Sensor**

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)
We use this sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595) for this exmaple to detect light (also RGB)
 
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector


<img src="imgs/IMG_0270.jpg" height="200" />
We need to use the screen to display the color detection, so we need to stop the running piscreen.service to make your screen available again

```bash
# stop the screen service
sudo systemctl stop piscreen.service
```

if you want to restart the screen service
```bash
# start the screen service
sudo systemctl start piscreen.service
```
 
2. **Server** (one person on laptop):
```bash
cd "Lab 6"  
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-server.txt
python app.py
```

2. **View in browser:**
   - Grid: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000`
   - Controller: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000/controller`

3. **Pi publisher** (everyone on their Pi):
```bash
# First time setup - create virtual environment
cd "Lab 6"
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-pi.txt

# Run the publisher
python pixel_grid_publisher.py
```

Hold colored objects near sensor to change your pixel!

## Part C: Make Your Own

**Requirements:**
- 3+ people, 3+ Pis
- Each Pi contributes sensor input via MQTT
- Meaningful or fun interaction

**Ideas:**

**Sensor Fortune Teller**
- Each Pi sends 0-255 from different sensor
- Server generates fortunes from combined values

**Frankenstories**
- Sensor events → story elements (not text!)
- Red = danger, gesture up = climbed, distance <10cm = suddenly

**Distributed Instrument**
- Each Pi = one musical parameter
- Only works together

**Others:** Games, presence display, mood ring

## Part A: MQTT Messaging
### 💡 MQTT Brainstorming (5 ideas)
#### 1) Emotion Lamps
Concept: 
Each Pi is a personal lamp. When someone sets their color/brightness, that “mood” ripples to others via MQTT, creating ambient, nonverbal presence across distance with gentle social synchrony.

Message Flow:
publish: IDD/mood/<user> → {"color":"#3366ff","brightness":0.7}
subscribe: all lamps blend/mirror incoming moods (e.g., weighted average or ripple animation).

#### 2) Distributed RGB Mixer (Tri-Station)
Concept: 
Three stations each control one channel (R/G/B) with gestures; any display mixes live color. Everyone's input is visibly essential.

Message Flow:
publish: IDD/rgb/<group>/set → {"r":120,"g":null,"b":200}
subscribe: mixers merge latest non-null channels and render.

#### 3) Proximity Color Bridge
Concept: 
Two lamps “link” when users bring their devices close (detected by distance sensor), temporarily sharing color states. It makes spatial relationships a networking trigger

Message Flow:
publish: IDD/link/<pair>/status → {"linked":true}
publish (while linked): IDD/link/<pair>/color → {"from":"A","color":"#ff5599"}
subscribe: partner lamp mirrors/blends while linked; unlinks on timeout.

#### 4) Rhythm Mesh (Beat & Sync)
Concept: 
One Pi is a tempo source; others contribute pattern density/accents to a shared light/sound metronome.

Message Flow:
publish (conductor): IDD/tempo/<group> → {"bpm":96,"phase":0.42}
publish (peers): IDD/pattern/<user> → {"accent":[0,1,0,0], "intensity":0.6}
subscribe: nodes render synchronized pulses.

#### 5) Door/Space Status Signal
Concept: Sensors publish room states (door open, occupancy, noise level); hallway signal change color accordingly; could be used as real utility + privacy-aware summarization

Message Flow:
publish: IDD/space/<room>/state → {"door":"open","people":3,"noise":0.2}
subscribe: beacons map states to colors (e.g., red=busy, green=free).

## Part C: Make Your Own
### Tri-Station RGB (3 Pis, 3 sensors, MQTT)
#### 1. Project Description
Our distributed system visualizes collaborative color creation across multiple Raspberry Pis. Each Pi represents one color channel: Red, Green, or Blue, and uses a proximity/light sensor (APDS-9960) to measure the amount of light or closeness of an object. The closer or brighter the object, the stronger that channel’s intensity (0-255). All three Pis publish their readings to a shared MQTT broker, where the values are combined on a central Flask + WebSocket server. The blended color is shown live on a web interface (a colored square that updates in real time).
#### 2. Architecture Diagram
**Hardware, connections, data flow**
- Pi-R: APDS-9960 proximity -> R (0 = far -> 0 red; 255 = close -> 255 red)
- Pi-G: APDS-9960 proximity -> G
- Pi-B: APDS-9960 proximity -> B

**Label input/computation/output**
- Input: APDS-9960 (Proximity Sensor) -> Raw 0-255 Reading
- Computation: each Pi -> MQTT Publish (IDD/rgb/set) -> Broker -> Central Flask Server (Subscribes and Mixes RGB)
- Output: OLED -> Display of Combined Color + Channel Values (R,G,B)
#### 3. Build Documentation
- refer to the GPIO pins: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/introduction-to-the-raspberry-pi-gpio-and-physical-computing/gpio-pins-overview
- set up and connect the APDS-9960 to the pi

<img src="proj_docs/setup.jpg" width="450"/>

- test connectivity with the python script given in Lab 4: https://github.com/siruiii/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/e6312114cebcaae3c90d2ad0683775de933f11d8/Lab%204/proximity_test.py

**Pi-1 as both the server and client**
```python
# terminal 1 (server)
cd rgb-proximity
pip install -r requirements.txt
hostname -I # record to use for other clients
python app.py # go to 0.0.0.0:5000 or localhost:5000

# terminal 2 (client - red)
python3 pi/proximity_publisher.py --pi-id pi_red --host localhost --port 1883 --mode apds9960 --near-cm 5 --far-cm 80 --debug
```
**Pi-2 and Pi-3 as clients**
```python
# (client - green), replace hostname with Pi-1's ip address
python3 pi/proximity_publisher.py --pi-id pi_green --host hostname --port 1883 --mode apds9960 --near-cm 5 --far-cm 80 --debug

# (client - blue), replace hostname with Pi-1's ip address
python3 pi/proximity_publisher.py --pi-id pi_blue --host hostname --port 1883 --mode apds9960 --near-cm 5 --far-cm 80 --debug
```

- open `0.0.0.0:5000 or localhost:5000` to view the collaborative color creation
#### 4. User Testing
- Participants: 3 users collaboratively testing the distributed system
- individual testing: https://youtube.com/shorts/CXWO7DWEKEI?si=dwUA3BNMexmJMCtY
- collabration: https://youtu.be/3GFww_l1DMc?feature=shared

**What did they think before trying?**
```
- They expected each Pi to work separately. 
- They discovered how hand distance from each sensor affected the mix. 
- When all three moved hands at once, they saw smooth color transitions and tried to match target colors for fun.
```

**What surprised them?**
```
They were surprised by how small movements affected group color. They liked the immediacy of seeing everyone’s contribution.
```

**What would they change?**
```
- Add color name for feedback
- Add visual feedback on each station to see individual intensity.
- Include sound or vibration when all three channels reach balance (white light).
- Make the web UI larger or include RGB value numbers.
```

#### 5. Reflection
**What worked well?**
```
- MQTT communication was smooth
- Physical collaboration made abstract networking concepts tangible.
- The color blending reinforced interdependence. No single Pi could control the full outcome.
```
**Challenges with distributed interaction?**
```
- Each APDS-9960 had slightly different baseline proximity readings.
- Ambient lighting caused noisy color shifts.
- One Pi occasionally dropped connections.
```

**How did sensor events work?**
```
- Our sensors worked through a continuous stream of proximity readings from each APDS-9960, where every Pi translated distance into a color intensity value and published it to the MQTT broker. 
- The server combined the latest red, green, and blue inputs to generate a blended color that updated instantly on the web interface. 
- Each person’s movement directly affected the shared outcome.
```

**What would you improve?**
```
- We would make the sensors more consistent. 
- Add slider UI on the screen to show each color’s value.
- Improve the sensor reading so the color changes in real time.
```
