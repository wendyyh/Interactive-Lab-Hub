## Project Plan

This project will be done by **Jully Li (hl2568), Weicong Hong (wh528), Feier Su (fs495), Sirui Wang (sw2449)** in collaboration.

### Big Idea

#### Object Journal Dock — Tangible Memory Device
**What We’re Building**
- An RFID-based interactive device that recognizes physical objects. When an object is placed on the dock, the device displays past journals or recorded feelings linked to it.
- Users can add new voice or text entries, creating a tangible memory system that connects emotions to objects.
- *Note:* We will first prototype the system using **NFC** instead of RFID, since the TA is providing an NFC kit, and then transition to RFID only if needed.

**Fall-back Plan**
The project can pivot to use a QR code-based recognition system. Generate Unique QR code for each object using existing python library and decode them via camera.

### Timeline

**November 15** - Finalize device concept & define recognition logic, user flow: Decide detection approach and explore recognition logic

**November 19** - Implement object recognition prototype: UI display, Pi physical UI, validate recognition reliability

**November 23** - Integrate journaling interface: Combine recognition system with journaling UI and PiTFT display.

**December 1** - Functional check-off: Fully working demo: object recognized, previous journals displayed, new entries recordable

**December 8** - Final Presentation: Organize everything into a coherent presentation; complete README

**December 15** - Write-up and documentation
